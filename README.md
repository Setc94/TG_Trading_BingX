# TG_Trading_BingX
trade with telegram signal channel and bingx account

Run automated trading on your BingX account by copying Signals from our <a href="https://t.me/Elon_crypto_signals">Telegram channel</a> or any other channel you want to copy trades and signals from.  
All this happens automatically.  
All you need to do is create an API KEY on the BingX platform and then add the Telegram login information in ENV: api_hash and app_id.

Set the entry amount for each trade and the leverage.

A text file will be created containing a detailed report of all the trades you've entered and their outcomes.

The bot only enters trades with moderate risk to avoid losses.

The bot sets the first target as the take-profit target and automatically sets the stop loss.

You can run the bot on your own VPS or contact us to set up your settings in our vps.

To run the bot, install the libraries using the following code:

pip install -r requirements.txt


and then run the main file.  

If you want a bot that trades on another platform,or need the bot token in vip channel Just :contact us :)
